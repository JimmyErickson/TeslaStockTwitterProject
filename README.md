# TeslaStockTwitterProject

The Tesla Stock Twitter Project uses data pulled from the Twitter API in order to predict Tesla's stock performance for the next day. I pull tweets and run a sentiment analysis on the text of the tweet in order to give me more information about the mood of twitter toward Tesla on any given day. This repository only has the Twitter scraper script for my project, due to the nature of this project. The analysis was performed in Microsoft Power BI, and the output script was made with Python.
